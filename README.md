# Cancer Classification Model

## Project Overview

This repository contains machine learning models designed for cancer classification using various algorithms including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging, XGBoost, and Stacking. The models analyze various features from a cancer dataset to classify samples as malignant or benign.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/Cancer_Classification_Model.git
cd Cancer_Classification_Model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Description

The dataset contains features extracted from breast cancer cell nuclei, including:
- Radius
- Texture
- Perimeter
- Area
- Smoothness
- And other characteristics

Each sample is classified as malignant (1) or benign (0).
